## Development

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the development server by running `npm run start-all`. This will run both the React build toolchain as well as the custom-boostrap less toolchain in parallel.
- Compile an optimized build with `npm run build`, and then upload the entire build directory to your web host.
